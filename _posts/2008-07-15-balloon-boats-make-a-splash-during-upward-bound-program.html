    <p>Today, CUAUV participated in the Cornell Exploration Series portion of the Upward Bound program. The goal of the program is to provide academic instruction and college preparation to high school students from the Elmira and Groton areas. The team presented Triton to the eleven students, and showed card suit and face recognition demos (above right). The event culminated in a balloon-powered boat building activity (above left).
