  On July 7, CUAUV boarded the floating classroom project and set course for the southern end of Cayuga Lake. The purpose of our visit was to observe the effectiveness of an herbicide in deterring the spread of Hydrilla, an invasive plant species, to the mouth of Cayuga Lake. Ragnark was deployed at Crowbar Point, on Cayuga Lake, transmitting video footage of the murky green waters to those on board the MV Haendel.
