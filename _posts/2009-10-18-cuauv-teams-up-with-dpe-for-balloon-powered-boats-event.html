<p>On Saturday, October 17 CUAUV hosted a Balloon-Powered Boats Challenge for high school students participating in the Diversity Programs in Engineering (DPE) Prospective Candidates' Weekend. Students were split into groups of two and collaborated with CUAUV team members to create a balloon-propelled paper boat. To promote creativity and innovation, students were given limited time and resouces consisting of only one sheet of newspaper, an arms length of tape, a zip tie, one straw, and one balloon. The high school students enjoyed working in CUAUV's lab workspace.  They had the opportunity to learn about the team and pose questions about Cornell Engineering as a whole.
