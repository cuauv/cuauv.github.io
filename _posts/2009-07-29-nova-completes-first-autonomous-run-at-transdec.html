<p>This morning, Nova had its first autonomous run at TRANSDEC. This first test was very successful. The vehicle passed through the validation gate, rammed the buoy, followed a pipeline, went under the barbed wire, grabbed the briefcase, and surfaced in the recovery zone. Continual updates will be posted here for the duration of the competition.</p>
