<p>CUAUV held its first pool test of our spring semester on Sunday, January 24.  We tested all Nova systems to make sure everything was working, and took pictures of some new mission props: the 2x2 window we hope will be in the 2010 competition mission as a torpedo launching task.  Pictures can be found in the <a href="http://www.cuauv.org/image/tid/79">pooltest 1/24 gallery</a>.  &nbsp;</p><p><img src="/files/forward_middle.jpg" alt="forward_middle.jpg" width="250" /></p>
