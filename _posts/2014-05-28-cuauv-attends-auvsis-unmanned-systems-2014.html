Several members of CUAUV were invited by the AUVSI Foundation to attend AUVSI's Unmanned Systems 2014 conference, and showcase our new autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) - Gemini - in the AUVSI Foundation/Student Pavilion.

  Attending the Unmanned Systems Conference was a valuable experience, allowing us to meet up with many of our current sponsors, pursue future sponsors, and showcase Cornells newest AUV to many industry experts. The conference brings together around 8,000 leading experts in autonomous maritime, underwater, air, and ground vehicles. Sharing ideas with these industry professionals will also give us an opportunity to gain some of their expertise, and apply that to our own engineering practices. We will also had the opportunity to attend many different talks and special interest presentations.

  In addition, we were interviewed by and featured on EngineeringTV! You can see the video at http://www.engineeringtv.com/video/Cornell-Student-s-Robotic-Submar.
