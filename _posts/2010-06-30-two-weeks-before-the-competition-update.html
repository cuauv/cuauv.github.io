We continue to test daily with our vehicle, running both tethered and untethered autonomous runs with the full course.  Full shrouding has been installed, along with the new switch box, an LCD screen, and the air system.  Marker droppers work well with the new markers, and the torpedo launching system is on the vehicle, though we are still short torpedoes.  An active grabber is designed, and has started to be manufactured: we hope to have it built and installed on the vehicle by the end of the week.
