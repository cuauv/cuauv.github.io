CUAUV took part in its first lake test of the summer on June 19, 2011 with the Cayuga Lake Floating Classroom Project. This Eco-Cruise focused on showing participants from the Ithaca area the macrophyte growth at a depth of 20 feet. Despite some initial problems with water turbidity, Drekar was able to record video of the lake bottom. Check the Videos page to watch this footage!
