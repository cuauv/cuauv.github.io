On Sunday, April 17, 2011, CUAUV held its first control test with Drekar, the new vehicle, at Teagle Pool. Drekar functioned very well, resulting in a quick and smooth test. Vehicle control worked surprisingly well with zero tweaking, and it seems that Drekar is already faster than Tachyon. More testing will be performed next week.
