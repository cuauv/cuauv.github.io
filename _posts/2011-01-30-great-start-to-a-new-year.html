After a restful break, we are excited to begin a busy semester before the competition!  We have met many of the deadlines we had set last semester for the vehicle.  On top of continuing to design and build our vehicle, we have many business and public relations events coming up!  We are running our annual Girl Scouts workshop, which provides the girls an opportunity to earn their Science in Action badges. We also are collaborating with Cornell's Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers for a science and technology outreach program with a local middle school. Finally, we are participating in BOOM, an annual showcase held by Cornell of student research and creativity in digital technology and applications.

    For sponsors interested in recruiting Cornell undergraduates on-campus, we plan to host company information sessions during Cornell's Engineering and Technical Spring Career Fair.  Moreover, we can supply a rsum book for those interested in hiring CUAUV members.  We look forward to seeing you at the fair!
