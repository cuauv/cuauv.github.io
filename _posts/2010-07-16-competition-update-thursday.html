Today we continued to tackle Tachyons vision issues with the suns glare. We tried numerous solutions including making a camera lens shroud and switching out our Firewire Guppy camera for a webcam. Ultimately we determined the Firewire Guppy camera was still advantageous and our software team resolved our vision problems through coding. During our last practice slot of the day, we ran an autonomous run, which included going through the validation gate and hedge, hitting the orange buoy, sensing the pinger, and recovering and surfacing with the counselor.
    Tonight we are working on continuing to tune the bin and buoy code, and work on our active grabber.  Tomorrow we will test the modified vision code in practice.  Our static judging time is at 3:00pm, and our qualifying run is at 5:00pm.
