The sub arrived this morning at 9:30 and construction started immediately after hauling it back to the room. As of noon, the sub is almost entirely completed, computer communications are up and running, and all the components have been leak tested. We got access to the dock beside the hotel, so we hope to be putting it into the water in a few hours. Photos coming soon.
