CUAUV has won the 12th annual international AUVSI competition.  The team is extremely impressed with the vehicles and performances of its competitors.  CUAUV learned many things which will help in the development of next year's vehicle.  Cornell has not placed first in this competition since 2003.  The team will be leaving San Diego tomorrow and is excited to begin work on next year's design in a couple weeks.
