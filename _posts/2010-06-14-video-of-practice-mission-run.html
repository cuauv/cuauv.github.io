<p>For the last week, CUAUV has been running fully autonomous mission runs with Tachyon, both tethered and untethered, in preparation for the competition.  Tachyon is consistently running a full course consisting of: Buoy, pipe, hedge, pipe, windows, pipe, bins, hydrophones/recovery.  While we are still working on the final marker droppers, torpedo launchers, and grabbers, the mission and vision are working very well.  Here is a video of one of Thursday's autonomous runs.</p>
