<p> Tonight, we presented to the boy scout troops about the team and the vehicle. The presentation turned out very well with the young scouts very excited to learn more about the vehicle.

  CUAUV will most likely be hosting a Boy Scouts Workshop either this semester or next fall semester in addition to the Girl Scouts Workshop on March 10.
