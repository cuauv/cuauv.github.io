  <p>Today brought even more teams arriving more than normal extremely early hours just in order to sign up for the earliest possible time slots. We arrived the earliest we had this week, but we still were only fifth in line. Thankfully, we were still able to get two practice runs in addition to our semi-final run. </p>
  <p>We decided to have a late practice run at 11:00 in order to see how Ragnark would react to brighter lighting conditions. Our practice run brought some issues with the pipes and buoys, but the mission after the buoys went just swimmingly.

  <p>We then had another semifinal run at 4:00. The way the judging works is that the judges take the best of your two semi-final scores to determine whether or not you advance to the final round. We are always trying to do the best that we and Ragnark can do, but since we had already scored well enough in our first semi-final run, it would not be detrimental to our advancement if we did not do well in the second semi-final run. </p>

  <p>This was good for us because we encountered many problems in the second run. The reason for the problem was unknown, and, even though we tried to restart the mission multiple times, we were unable to get the mission to work properly. So software decided to use the remaining time to test hydrophones. We ended up second in our placement of the semi-final runs, but we still were able to get the time slot we wanted to do our final run on Sunday.</p>

  <p>We got another practice run in later on that day, and software was able to find and fix the error from the previous semi-final run. </p>
  <p>After returning to the hotel from TRANSDEC, software worked on code, and everyone tried to get a good night's worth of sleep for the coming day: finals day. </p>
