As a part of the floating classroom project, CUAUV's vehicle Nova was deployed in Cayuga lake on Sunday, July 12 to survey mid-summer Macrophyte growth.  Despite windy and wavy conditions and poor visibility, Nova was able to run a 10m x 10m search pattern and come back with some good picture of bottom growth.
