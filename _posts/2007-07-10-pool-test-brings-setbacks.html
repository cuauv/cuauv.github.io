    Today's list of problems grew after this evening's pool test. We were proud to bring our fully assembled vehicle to our hotel's pool for testing (above), but after several minutes in the water, a battery pod leaked and damaged the circuitry inside. Further testing of the other battery pods led to another leak and circuit failure. We still have two pairs of pods remaining, but we are being very cautious to verify the pods' sealings before further pool testing can continue. Erin Fischell will be working very hard tonight to make these verifications.
