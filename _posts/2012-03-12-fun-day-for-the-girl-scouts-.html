  On Saturday, March 10, 2012, CUAUV collaborated with SWE to host the Girl Scout Workshop. The girl scouts went through a series of activities at different stations including the water tricks, lab tour, newspaper bridge building and kaleidoscope making stations to earn their badges (and have fun doing so). Parents of the scouts got a chance to talk to a panel of members of CUAUV and SWE about the different kinds of engineering and what engineering is in general. The event was very successful.

  Special thank-you goes to SWE and Turner for their support.
