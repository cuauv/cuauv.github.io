The first team social of 2011 was competitive. From intense X-box games to Quelf to Settlers of Catan, the members of the CUAUV team brought their game faces last night. Despite the very strange noises that arose from those engaged in Quelf, the team had a great time playing games, relaxing, and eating cake. Maybe the Quelf players laughed and asymptoteed each other  carelessly, but those playing Settlers were concentrated in their quest to conquer Catan! Everyone had a great time, and we look forward to our next team social in March!
