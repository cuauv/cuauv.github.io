<p> After a long, stressful, and very exciting day of finals, we put Ragnark in the TRANSDEC waters for his last time.</p>

  <p> We had had one practice run earlier that day where most of the run went well except that Ragnark had trouble detecting the pipe right after the gate. An exciting part of the run was when Ragnark was able to turn the steering wheel 1080 degrees.</p>

  <p>At 1:00 the final runs began. We all watched the other teams compete, until it was finally our turn.</p>
  <p> Ragnark's final run was probably his best run of the entire competition. He went straight through the gate, found the first pipe, rammed the orange buoy, drove sideways through the parallel parking gate, missed the first torpedo, got the second torpedo through the small hole, hit both bins dead center, shifted the lever, attempted but did not fully turn the steering wheel, and completed the pizza delivery task all with five minutes left on the clock.</p>

  <p>Everyone was extremely happy about how the final run turned out, and proceeded to throw Markus Burkardt into the dolphin pool as is CUAUV tradition when we achieve first place.</p>
  <p>Later that night was the formal banquet where they announced the official scores. After the ceremony, we disassembled Ragnark and packed everything up to be shipped home the next day</p>
