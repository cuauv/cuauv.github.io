Today was an eventful day at the competition.  We had two practice runs and our first qualifying run.  After a few false starts, we were able to run buoy, pipe, hedge, windows (got 1 torpedo through an incorrect window due to a actuator issue), hydrophone to to recovery zone, pick up the recover object, surface, and release the object.  We also gave our static judging presentation, and placed first in static judging.  Tonight, after going out to a sit-down mexican dinner to celebrate, we are working on our pneumatic system to hopefully increase reliability for firing torpedoes.  Tomorrow we are hoping to be able to run the course.
