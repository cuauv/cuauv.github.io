<p>On Saturday, March 6, 2010, Girl Scouts from all over Upstate New York came to Cornell University to earn their Science in Action Badge. This is the forth year the team has run the event and it has been our largest yet, with participation from 12 troops and about 80 girl scouts. The girls had the opportunity to rotate through 5 stations led by various team members, including one station with guest presenters from the Cayuga Fire Department. The final station brought all the girls together to design and build the tallest tower out of newspaper and scotch tape. Thanks to all the troops that attended our workshop. We hope you had as much fun as we did!</p>
