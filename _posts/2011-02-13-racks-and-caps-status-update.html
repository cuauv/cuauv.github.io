The Racks and Caps sub-team has recently finished the design for the Upper Hull Pressure Vessel (UHPV). Since the purpose of the UHPV is to keep the surrounding water out of the machine, the Racks and Caps team has made sure the material used is not only waterproof but bulletproof as well. The electronic rack, which holds up the electronic boards, is almost finished. The Racks and Caps team has also installed larger fans to cool the running computer. However, for CUAUV, bigger does not always mean better, because this years UHPV model is about half the size of last years. And finally, the Racks and Caps team just installed a total of 5 layers to hold the being-built electronic boards. Stay tuned to our weekly status updates regarding the recent finish of our design process...
