    <p>On Wednesday, July 30, the team went to TRANSDEC for the first day of practice at the competition pool. By having Triton pass through the validation gate during the first practice run, CUAUV became the first team to pre-qualify for the 2008 AUVSI competition. A total of eleven teams pre-qualified today; the others will have a chance to do so tomorrow.  Testing for the rest of the day has been successful, with Triton consistently executing mission elements and capturing many underwater images.</p>
