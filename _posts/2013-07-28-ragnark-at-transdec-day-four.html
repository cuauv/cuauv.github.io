<p>The first semi-final runs were today!</p>

  <p>CUAUV was able to place into the finals with the scores from our first semi-final runs. Overall, the run went smoothly. We had some time issues, we werent able to complete the driving task due to some vision problems causing that mission to time out. We also were picking up the wrong pinger when we went for the hydrophones task, causing more time delays. We did have enough time to complete part of the hydrophones task, however. We were still able to locate one of the pingers, find the recovery object, descend upon the object, and grab it with the piston arms. However, since we were very low on time, that mission timed out right as we grabbed the recovery object, causing us to release it instantly and surface. We did surface in the target areas, allowing for some more points to be grabbed. We also managed to go through the gates, follow four pipes,  ram both the orange buoy and an led buoy, fire a torpedo through a small hole, and drop a marker into the number 10 bin.

  <p>Afterwards, software decided to work on making it so that we decreased the amount of time we spent searching in between elements. We decided to do a later semi-final run on Saturday in order to prepare for possibly sunnier lighting conditions during the final run as well.</p>
