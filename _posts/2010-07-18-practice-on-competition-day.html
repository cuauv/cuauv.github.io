For those of you who have not been following <a href="http://twitter.com/cuauv" mce_href="http://twitter.com/cuauv">twitter</a>, Tachyon performed very well in our practice earlier today. Our first attempt was a nearly perfect run, hitting both the yellow and orange buoy, shooting both torpedoes into the blue window and dropping markers into the clipper and axe bins.

    We then tried an untethered autonomous that had to be cut short when Tachyon strafed into the wall after passing the hedge. The problem was concluded to be a missed pipe followed by a slightly miscalculated heading angle. These problems have been fixed for our final run at 4:15pm.

    Make sure to follow our final run on the <a href="http://www.todocast.tv/500films/auv2010/" mce_href="http://www.todocast.tv/500films/auv2010/">webcast</a>!
