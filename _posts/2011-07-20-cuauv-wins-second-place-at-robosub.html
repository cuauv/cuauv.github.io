Congratulations CUAUV for scoring second place in the 14th annual AUVSI RoboSub Competition, and a big congratulations to our friends over at ETS SONIA for first!  Hopefully everyone at home was able to watch the finals via the live webcast, but if not, you can see recap videos of the competition at <a href="robosub.org">robosub.org</a>.

    The final day of the competition was both exciting and nerve racking.  Unfortunately, the weather was not on our side this day as the clouds never fully cleared until after our final run.  The day began with a practice run in the competition side of the pool, as the practice side was being used for the Second Chance part of the competition.  The practice run was very successful, as we were able to quickly complete almost all of the course.  Towards the end of the run as we were attempting the hydrophones task, we encountered the same error which stopped us dead in our tracks during last year's finals.  Thankfully, our software team was able to come up with a quick solution to the problem so that if it happened during our final run we could still continue.

    The final run started well with us navigating through the gate and hit the green buoy.  Unfortunately, we appeared to be hung up on the yellow one.  After asking the divers to bring the sub back and changing the code slightly, we started the run again.  This time, though, there were two instances of the mission running which again caused problems.  The sub was brought back in and the code was changed once more.  On its final run, the sub went through the gate, rammed the green buoy twice (this was done on purpose, as we believed the first error may have been a vision problem caused by the cloudy day), and overall navigated several pipes.  At this point, the sub timed out on the mission and went directly to the hydrophones task which it completed perfectly with only 10 seconds to spare!  After the run, we were able to determine that the cause of the first error was due to a race condition error in our mission code.

    Although things did not go exactly the way we wanted them to in our final run, we are still extremely proud of how Drekar performed at RoboSub this year and very happy to take home second place.  Again, congratulations to everyone at CUAUV, ETS SONIA, and all other teams at the competition this year!  We're looking forward to next year's competition and can't wait to see all of you again!
