As a part of the floating classroom project, CUAUV's vehicle Triton was deployed and recovered twice in Cayuga lake today.  Triton examined the Macrophyte growth on the bottom of the southwest end of Cayuga lake.  For a video of one of the bottom traverses examining weed growth, go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIXdf2x2eQs <p> <img src="/files/images/VehicleInlake.jpg" width="200" alt="VehicleInlake.jpg" /> <img src="/files/images/SDC13125.jpg" width="200" alt="SDC13125.jpg" /> <img src="/files/images/SDC13110.jpg" width="200" alt="SDC13110.jpg" />
