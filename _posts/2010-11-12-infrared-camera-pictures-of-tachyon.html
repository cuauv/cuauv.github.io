We have uploaded photos of Tachyon taken using an infrared camera to our <a href="/images/fall-2010/">Fall 2010 image gallery</a>!
    By taking photos of Tachyon before and after running vision software, we found out that our computer heats to over 200?F

    Huge thanks to Mark from the Cornell Department of Design & Environmental Analysis and Shawn from Cornells Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County for lending us the camera!
