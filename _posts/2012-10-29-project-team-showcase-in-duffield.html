  On Friday, October 19, CUAUV, alongside other engineering project teams set up a table to showcase our vehicle to the public. Members were present to answer questions and talk about the team and vehicle. We talked to many alumni of the Engineering School, interested students and professors, and certainly impressed many people. Keep up the good work!
