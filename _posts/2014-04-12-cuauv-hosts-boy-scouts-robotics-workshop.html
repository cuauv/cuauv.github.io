CUAUV and CUAir co-hosted the Boy Scouts Robotics Workshop for scouts around the Ithaca area to earn their Robotics Merit Badge. 17 scouts came to Cornell's campus to learn about robotics and engineering, and then build their own SeaPerch submarines! Both the scouts and CUAUV/CUAir team members had a lot of fun building the submarines and then testing them in a pool outside.
