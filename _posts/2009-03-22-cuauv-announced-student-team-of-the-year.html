CUAUV has just been awarded the College of Engineering Alumni Association Undergraduate Student Team of the Year Award, which includes a monetary prize of $1000.

    Since 2001, each year the advising office solicits student groups to nominate themselves and explain what they did during the year that makes them excellent. Then the office of the Associate Dean for Engineering Undergraduate Program, usually in conjunction with the office of Alumni Affairs and Development, makes the final selection for this award. Recently, this award has been renamed as Albert R. George Student Team Award to honor the dedication, commitment, and support Professor Al George has shown to student teams and the engineering community.

    Congratulations everyone!
