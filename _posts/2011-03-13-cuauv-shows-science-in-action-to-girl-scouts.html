On March 12th, 2011, the Cornell University Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (CUAUV) project team hosted a workshop for Girl Scouts intending to earn their Science in Action badges.  CUAUV has held this workshop for the past four years, and the attendance has always been large.  This year, fifty Girl Scouts were present at the event, and all of them were entertained by the activities prepared by the team.  All of the girls cycled through five stations, and at each station, they learned principles of science through hands on demonstrations, such as how sound travels by making a telephone out of two cups and a string and how bridges support heavy loads by making a bridge out of newspaper.
