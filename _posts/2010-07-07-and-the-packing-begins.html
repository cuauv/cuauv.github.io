We have started the process of packing up to ship to San Diego.  First to go into boxes: backup cables and o-rings.  As some people start to pack, others are finishing final touches on Tachyon and making backups including backup thruster, sensor power, and merge boards.  The new grabber grabs great, and is undergoing a little more machining to make it drop better (it dropped the object intermittently in yesterday's test).  We are going to an outdoor pool(from 8am-10am) tomorrow to see how Tachyon's new camera performs with the forward mission elements under bright sunlight.  <p><center><a href="/files/2010summer/Packingbegins.jpg"><img src="/files/2010summer/Packingbegins.preview.jpg" alt="Shipping crates ready to be packed" /></a><a href="/files/2010summer/PopulatingBackups.jpg"><img src="/files/2010summer/PopulatingBackups.preview.jpg" alt="Tom Jackson testing the backup thruster board." /></a></p>
