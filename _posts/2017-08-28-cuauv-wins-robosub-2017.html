  Thanks to all the great work everyone put in last year, we are happy to announce that CUAUV placed 1st this past summer at the annual RoboSub competition! Cornell was competing against many other great teams, and the top 5 schools (in order) were Cornell University, Far East Federal University/ Institute for Marine Technology Problems, National University of Signapore, Harbin Engineering University, and Georgia Institute of Technology. This now makes CUAUV a seven-time RoboSub champion and we look forward to continuing to pursue our tradition of excellence!
