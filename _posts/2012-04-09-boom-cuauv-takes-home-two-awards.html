On April 4th, CUAUV participated in Cornell's annual event BOOM (Bits on Our Minds) to put our vehicle on display and present about the team. BOOM is Cornell's annual showcase of digital technologies and their applications by students. Visitors are treated to live demos of the vehicles camera recognition ability and videos of the vehicle running underwater. Team members were also present to answers questions about the vehicle and the team. The hard work put up by the team did not go unnoticed as CUAUV won not one but two awards! The awards were the Google Award and the Peoples Choice Award.
