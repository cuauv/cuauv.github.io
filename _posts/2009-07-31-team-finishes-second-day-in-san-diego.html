Practice runs yesterday went very well.  Nova was able to autonomously complete all tasks and only encountered problems in transitioning from the torpedo nest to the bins.  The team prepared for static juding today.  CUAUV also has a 2:00pm PST qualifying run.  Follow us on twitter for up to the minute news.
