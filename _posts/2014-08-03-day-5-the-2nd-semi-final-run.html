For the first time during the competition, the unrelenting sun in San Diego took a break. Instead of the instant sunburn inducing brightness in TRANSDEC, ominous clouds hovered over us. This sudden difference in weather forecast meant bad news for many teams, for all of us have tuned our vision in the consistent sunny days in prior practice days.

  Despite the gloomy weather and sudden downpour, many teams had significantly betters run today than in the 1st semi-final run. Improving from yesterday's mission, software adjusted the appropriate offset of the grabbers. In contrast to the 60% success grab rate in university pool, in TRANSDEC, we were missing majority of our grabs. The offset may have resulted from the tuning controls with tether connected to our vehicle, which would have caused slight difference from untethered autonomous runs. Fortunately, the software adjustments proved to be successful.

  Considering our score from 1st semi-final run yesterday, we had high chance of qualifying to finals. However, we still aimed to perfect our recovery task. We were excited to see how many of the other teams were more successful today.

  Valve enclosure, thruster board, and computer did not act up today, and we are hoping no more problems will reoccur for just one more day. Best of luck to everyone and see you tomorrow for the finals. Get a good sleep everyone!
