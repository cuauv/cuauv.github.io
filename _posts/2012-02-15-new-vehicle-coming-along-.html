<p> As the new semester starts, CUAUV has been working hard on completing the 2012 vehicle, Killick. The team had finished preparing the major parts of the vehicle!

  The picture shows the front end cap, valve enclosure, track bulk heads, thruster modification, collar, end cap, pistons, and camera enclosures.
