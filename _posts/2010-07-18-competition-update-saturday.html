Today the team focused on improving Tachyons torpedo firing abilities. We spent a lot of time in the dolphin pool making changes to the fire time of the torpedoes and the depth at which they are pushed into the launcher tube.

    In our first practice run, Tachyon managed to complete the validation gate, pipe, hedge and buoy missions. Tachyon fired the torpedo into the yellow window instead of the blue, and failed to pick up the counselor. In the second practice, Tachyon completed all the tasks perfectly including the torpedo fire, but failed to drop the counselor at the end of mission. Our qualification run had similar results to our practices: gate, one buoy, fired torpedo but missed targeted window, bins, hedge, recovered counselor but did not release.

    We placed first in the qualification rounds (all teams results in previous post) allowing us first pick in tomorrow time slots practice 11:00pm, finals 4:15pm.

    Our goal for tomorrow is the same as always: to run the course.
