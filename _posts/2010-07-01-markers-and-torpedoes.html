Yesterday we ran our first full pooltest with two markers and two torpedoes.  Everything went great: air no longer gets into our camera lens (thanks to holes in the marker dropper tubes), the new torpedoes (with custom cast acrylic fins and pvc heads) fly straight, the markers drop dead center. We also decided to remove the front and rear shrouds, because they were causing too much roll.  They looked nice, but vehicle dynamics are more important. Next up, hopefully to go on the vehicle tomorrow: active grabber.
