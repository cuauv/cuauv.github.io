<p>The CUAUV team held its first pool test of the fall semester on Sunday, October 17. This pool test was spent configuring the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), which records the velocity of the vehicle.  The DVL was installed in last year's competition vehicle, Tachyon, for the test.  Pictures are included in the <a href="/images/fall-2010/">Fall 2010 image gallery</a>.</p>
