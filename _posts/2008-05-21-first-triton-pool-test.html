    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">On Sunday, May 11, CUAUV ran its first powered water test of the 2008 competition vehicle Triton.  During its entire duration in the Teagle Hall pool, the  vehicle was able to move under its own power.  Preliminary control tests also yielded promising results.  Minor problems with the motor controllers were identified during the run, and have since been fixed.  The team is very excited to build on this success!</p>
