Steady progress has been made on Argos functionality. The vehicle now sees regular time in Teagle pool as its hulls have successfully passed pressurized leak tests. The mechanical team continues work on its custom thrusters and second semester projects, which includes battery charging stations, an enclosure for a custom pinger, and the minisub. The electrical team is busy on their projects as the semester winds down, with development focused on improving the reliability of thruster boards, CAN drivers, and power distribution. Software team is collecting vision and sonar data for its vision modules and developing controllers for Argos new thrusters and vector thrusters.
