  <p>Letâ€™s give a big shout out to Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC) for helping us host a Boy Scouts programming workshop this past weekend. 44 boy scouts attended and earned their programming badge. It was a fun day of learning to code using using Python, JavaScript, and HTML. They also applied some of their programming logic to operate <a href = "http://ozobot.com" target="_blank"> Ozobots</a>. It was an amazing experience for CUAUV and WICC members to teach concepts that they use regularly. Hopefully we inspired some young students to get involved with STEM!</p>
