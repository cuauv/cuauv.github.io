On May 23, CUAUV deployed Tachyon in Cayuga lake off of the floating classroom boat, the Haendel.  Unfortunatly, wind caused the vehicle's tether to wrap under the boat, and we had to end the deployment early.  We did get some good pictures of the boat's hull and propellers using Tachyon, our first "hull inspection".  We used these pictures to cut loose the tether. Despite all of the difficulties, Tachyon performed well in a challenging environment with wind and waves and had no failures.
