High school and middle school students part of Lockheed Martin's Junior Explorers program visited the lab for a tour today. Members got to talk with some of the area's most passionate middle and high school students and share with them some of the challenges of building underwater and autonomous robots. We'd like to give a special thanks to Cornell Rocketry Team for joining us and showing their newest rocket, Chewbacca!
