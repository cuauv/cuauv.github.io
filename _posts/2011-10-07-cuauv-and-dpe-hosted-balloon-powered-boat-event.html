CUAUV collaborated with Diversity Programs in Engineering and hosted a balloon-powered boat event for students outside of the Cornell community. With the help of CUAUV team members, students were able to build a boat propelled by balloons and learned the concepts behind the propulsion. They worked in CUAUVs lab workspace and had an opportunity to learn about the team and last years competition vehicle.

  As we are currently working on the design of our vehicle this year, we have finalized the date for the Open Pool Test to be November 20th from 5:30  7:00 pm. The Open Pool Test gives the Cornell and Ithaca community an opportunity to see last years vehicle maneuver through an obstacle course similar to the one at the competition.
