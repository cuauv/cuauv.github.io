    CUAUVs new vehicle for this year is named Proteus after the Greek mythological figure, the son of Poseidon in Olympian mythology. He is
    famous for his ability to change shape and predict the future  a perfect symbol for our new vehicle which has morphed from the SeaMonkey into a sleeker and more reliable new model.
