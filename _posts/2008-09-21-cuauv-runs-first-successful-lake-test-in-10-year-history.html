    <p>CUAUV ran its first successful lake test on Saturday, September 20. At Wells College's dock in Aurora, the 2008 competition vehicle Triton was deployed in Cayuga Lake. Mission elements, as well as general vehicle functionality, were tested during this run. The team is excited about the results and hopes to get back into the lake soon.</p>
