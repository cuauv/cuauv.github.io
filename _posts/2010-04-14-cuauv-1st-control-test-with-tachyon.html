On Sunday, April 11, 2010, CUAUV held its first control test with Tachyon, the new vehicle, at Teagle.  Tachyon performed very well, and the team was able to quickly tune depth, heading and velocity.  More controls testing will be performed next week, when more of the final infrastructure is in place.  During the hour of run time, there were no leaks or failures within the sub.  This is the earliest that CUAUV has even gotten a one year vehicle running for a first control test.<p class="center">
