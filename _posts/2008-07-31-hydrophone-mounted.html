    <p>After a successful morning practice test where the vehicle autonomously completed pipe and buoy missions, CUAUV mounted the hydrophone. As part of the competition, the hydrophone will sense an acoustic pinger, retrieve the safe, and then surface in the proper recovery zone. The team is excited to use the hydrophone during the next scheduled practice run.</p>
