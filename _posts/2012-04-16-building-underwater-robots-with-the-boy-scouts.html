<p> This past Saturday, April 14, CUAUV, in collaboration with CUAIR, hosted a fun event for the boy scouts. The boy scouts were split into groups with two extra members from CUAUV to help them build underwater robots from kit boxes from SeaPerch. The scouts were given a hands-on experience in building the robots which included soldering, cutting parts and using epoxy to seal the parts. The finished robots were then tested in a small pool.

  The event turned out very successful! We'd like to make the Boy Scouts Workshop our annual event.

  Special thank-you goes to CUAIR for their support.
