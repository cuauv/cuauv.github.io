    The Upper Hull Pressure Vessel contains all of the serial, power, and control architecture for Tachyon.

    The pressure vessel diameter on Tachyon, 9.5, is larger than previous years to accommodate a much larger computer.  To compensate for the structural disadvantage, a thicker acrylic tube was used.  The pressure vessel itself consists of a rear endcap and a hull assembly, the aluminum parts for which were CNCed by students on the team.  The hull assembly slides over the Upper Hull Rack and mates with the rear endcap.  The hull assembly consists of a front endcap, acrylic hull, and hull collar.  The front endcap and the hull collar are epoxied to the acrylic hull using 3M DP-460 epoxy.  SEA CON connectors (MCBH-6, MCBH-8, and MCBH-10) pass through the rear endcap to provide an interface to external devices and power.

    The Upper Hull Rack holds all custom electronics infrastructure for power, control and serial systems, as well as the vehicle computer.
    Waterjet cut Delrin bulkheads give six slots for boards in each of two separate sections. The bulkhead design provides improved fan placement and wire management for the upper hull rack.   Electrically noisy, hot components are contained in the aft section where they can be cooled using fans circulating air to the rear endcap and hull collar, which act as heat sinks.  More temperature and noise sensitive electronics are kept in the sensor control section in the front.  Because the electrical system was designed into more discrete, flexible, elements it was much easier to maintain this separation in Tachyon.

    The Endcap Interface section contains all of the wires coming out of connectors in the rear endcap, as well as up to two fans to improve aft section cooling.  The Aft section holds the computer, fiber optic board and SSD, the actuator/thruster boards, and the merge/CPU distro boards.  The next section is a fan section, where up to four fans can be mounted.  The final section is the sensor control section, which contains the sensor power, serial, and general purpose input/output boards.</td></tr></tbody></table>
