<p>On Saturday, February 28, 2009, girl scouts from all over Upstate New York came to Cornell University to earn their Science in Action Badge. This is the third year that the team has run the event. The girls had the opportunity to rotate through 5 stations led by various team members. The final station brought all the girls together to design and build the tallest tower out of newspaper and scotch tape. CUAUV is very excited to have hosted the event again this year and hopes to continue its trend of inspiring today's youth.</p>
