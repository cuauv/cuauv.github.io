The CUAUV engineering project team hosted a workshop for prospective students on Monday, October 18. In addition to receiving a presentation on the team and the lab, the students had the opportunity to engage in many hands-on activities to better acquaint themselves with the vehicle.

    Students observed the read-outs from the vehicle when the hydrophones were set at different frequencies by the team and were also able to twist the hydrophone and move around the pinger to see how the angle reading changed. Students had a chance to examine torpedoes made from different materials and predict how they would be fired from the launcher. Lastly, with the software subteam's vision demonstration, students witnessed how the vehicle's shape recognition software worked.
