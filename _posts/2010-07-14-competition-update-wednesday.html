Today was our first day out at Transdec. We have been using our practice slots to acquire imagery and tune our vision systems. We have also been testing our hydrophones, which are working very well. We've had two practice slots so far and are scheduled for a third later today. Be sure to check out our Competition 2010 image gallery and follow our twitter feed for more up-to-date coverage of our time in San Diego.
