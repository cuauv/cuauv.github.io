    <p>CUAUV is very excited about the success of last week's pool tests. Early in the week,missions were runto use the altimeters to "bounce" off of the walls, and to hover overpipes and then follow the headings. The team also tested a second pipe finding vision algorithm which yielded promising results. Gathered categorized test images will also be beneficial for developing more vision algorithms in the coming weeks.</p>
