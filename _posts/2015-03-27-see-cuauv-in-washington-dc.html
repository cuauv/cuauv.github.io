In the Washington, D.C. area? CUAUV will travel to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum on Friday, April 3rd to kick off National Robotics Week. The team will join other robotics organizations and industry experts to celebrate innovation and research in the field. Well be showing off some of our work and speaking with visitors and other presenters. Were excited to be a part of this week and support the Smithsonian in this fantastic event.
