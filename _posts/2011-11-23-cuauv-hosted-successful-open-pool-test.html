  <p>On November 20, 2011, CUAUV hosted its annual Open Pool Test at Teagle Pool, showcasing its 2011 competition vehicle, Drekar, to the public. The audience was treated to light refreshments as they watched Drekar glide through obstacle courses, shoot torpedoes, and complete image recognition tasks. Thank you to everyone who came to the Open Pool Test, and we look forward to seeing everyone again in our future promotional events!
