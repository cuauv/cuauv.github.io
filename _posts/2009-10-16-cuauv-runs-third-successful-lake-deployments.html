On October 4, CUAUV ran its third Macrophyte growth survey in the Southwest end of Cayuga lake off of the Cayuga Lake Floating Classroom boat the Haendel.  Nova ran a long transect to determine the deepest depth of plant growth, then was taken back onto the boat to take pictures of the lakesource cooling outflow diffuser.
