The team has been very busy putting together more final touches onto Argo. The vehicles frame is largely assembled, and most of its enclosures have undergone successful leak tests. Electrical team has been working diligently to prepare its boards during integration, with boards housed in the UHPV having been connected to the vehicles backplane. Software continues work on its course simulator and controls, and have been working to ensure the vehicles computer is properly migrated into Argo. Visit us on Facebook, Twitter, and website to follow the vehicles latest progress!
