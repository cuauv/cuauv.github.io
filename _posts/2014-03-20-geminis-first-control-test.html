Gemini had its first control test this past Sunday at our weekly pool test! The entire team has been working very hard for the past few months and we are very proud that Gemini is finally in the water. We will still be working on Gemini in the upcoming months leading up to the competition. We'd like to thank everyone for all of the support and you will be seeing more of Gemini in the upcoming months!
