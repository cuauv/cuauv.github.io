After Annodized parts came back on Friday, Tachyon was fully assembled for the first time.  The upper hull was epoxied on Saturday in preparation for Tachyon's first official leak test this Sunday.  The vehicle sat for 5 hours on the bottom of Teagle pool without any upper hull leaks. Assembly continues this week, with all the mechanical and electrical parts being completed, assembled and tested.  The first control test will take place on Sunday, April 11.  This will give us one more Nova pool test.
