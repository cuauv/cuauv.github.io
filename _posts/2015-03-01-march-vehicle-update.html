The team has been working hard to begin integration for Argo at the start of this month. Mechanical team has been machining, sanding, and anodizing diligently to get their last batch of parts completed. Electrical has received their latest revisions of boards and are aiming to populate, test, and crimp in time for the in-water deadline. The software team is finishing integration of our new mission system and vision system (both started last semester), developing a new submarine and course simulator/visualizer, and continuing research on localization and controls. Be on the lookout for the reveal of our 2015 vehicle.
