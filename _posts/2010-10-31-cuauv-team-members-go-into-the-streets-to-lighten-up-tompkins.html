As part of the CUAUV team's community outreach activities, 9 of our team members participated in 'Into the Streets', a student directed program of the Cornell Public Service Center that promotes commitment to public service among college students on Saturday, October 30.

    As a part of 'Into the Streets', our team members took part in the public service event 'Lighten Up Tompkins', an initiative of Cornell Cooperative Extension of Tompkins County. The event involved hundreds of volunteers distributing bags containing energy saving tips and products such as energy-efficient light bulbs to 5000 homes across the county. The experience provided team members a worthwhile way to give back to the community and further interact across subteams.
