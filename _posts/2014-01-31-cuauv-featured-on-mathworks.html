<p>CUAUV is featured on MathWorks, one of the team&#39;s Gold Sponsors, for the team&#39;s success using MathWorks&#39; program. The team uses MATLAB to gather sensor and signal data and processes them in real time. These are crucial to the team&#39;s success at the competition every year and we are thankful for MathWorks&#39; sponsorship.
