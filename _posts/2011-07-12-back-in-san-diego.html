CUAUV is back in San Diego for the 14th annual AUVSI/ONR RoboSub Competition!  The first half of our team arrived in beautiful San Diego Sunday night, while the second half arrived Monday night.  Since our arrival, we have been diligently working to reassemble the sub and prepare it for the competition ahead.

    We're looking forward to seeing all of the great subs at RoboSub this year! Check back tonight and every night following for updates on the team, the competition, and, of course, Drekar!
