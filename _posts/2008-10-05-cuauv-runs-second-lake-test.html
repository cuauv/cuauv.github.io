    <p>On Saturday, October 4, CUAUV ran its second lake test in Cayuga Lake. Deploying again from Well's College's dock, the team assessed lake conditions and tested the vehicle's Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). Due to the quickly dropping temperatures, the team probably will not run another test until the spring.</p>
