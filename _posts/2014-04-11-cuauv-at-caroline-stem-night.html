On Thursday, April 10th, CUAUV participated in Caroline Elementary School's STEM Night and talked to young kids about robotics and engineering. This is the first Caroline STEM Night and over 280 people showed up! We talked about our sub and did visual recognition demos with the kids and they loved it! It was a great experience for the team and we hope to be a part of it in the future again.
