Cornell placed first in static judging at the AUVSI competition.  Static judging focuses on vehicle design communicated through the team's journal paper and website, as well as an oral presentation.

    Based on this finish, CUAUV got to choose its qualifying run time tomorrow first.  Nova will be in the pool at 2pm PST.  Follow us on twitter for updates of this run.
