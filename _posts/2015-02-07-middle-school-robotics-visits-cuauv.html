The team is back from winter break and work resumes on the vehicle. Amidst all of the activity being done to integrate the vehicle, the team has had some fun opportunities to get out into the community! On February 6th, we hosted Danforth Middle School's underwater robotics team from Syracuse. A team of around 15 students visited the lab to learn about marine robotics, and then joined forces with CUAUV members to help further the design and implementation of Danforth's own ROVs. We provided some tips on mechanical structure, electrical wiring, and soldering. Danforth plans to compete in the MATE ROV competition this year, and we are excited to follow their progress in the coming months.
