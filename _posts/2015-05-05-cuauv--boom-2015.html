The team joined many other Cornell student projects for the Bits On Our Mind showcase in March. We got the chance to show off our past and present vehicles, engage with other student innovators, and interact with the community. We were inspired by the innovative and collaborative atmosphere of the event, and even got some time in the spotlight. Check out a video recapping the event that features CUAUV and members Ricardo Stephen '18 and Jonathan Chan '18.
