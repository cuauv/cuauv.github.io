    This weekend CUAUV hosted a Girl Scout Workshop where four troops from the local area were taught the information they needed to earn their Science in Action Badges.  The workshop included five stations where the girls learned about bridge building, cell phones, firefighters, engineers, and CUAUV in general.  There was also a special presentation by an electrical engineering professor here at Cornell, Sheila Hemami, who was featured on the girl scout website explored by the girls, engineergirl.org.  The workshop was an enormous success. Be sure to look for an article about it in the Cornell Chronicle!
