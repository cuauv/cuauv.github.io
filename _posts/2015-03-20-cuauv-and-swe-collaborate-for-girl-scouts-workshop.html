On March 14th, CUAUV joined forces with the Society of Women of Engineers (SWE) to host over 60 Girl Scouts Juniors in a science-related workshop. Students from Ithaca and the surrounding area came to Upson Hall to storyboard their own movie, animate their own artwork, learn about acoustics, and build miniature roller coasters. They also got a chance to visit our lab, see previous vehicles, and play science word games. In the end, the scouts earned their Entertainment Technology badge. It was a fun-filled day and we are happy to have been able to work with SWE to put on a successful workshop! You can check out more pictures from the event on our Facebook page.
