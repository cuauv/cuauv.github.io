  <p><b>Why did you join CUAUV and what is your favorite part about it?</b></p>

  <p>I joined AUV for many reasons. It was primarily because I wanted a hands on experience in mechanical engineering and AUV seemed like one of the best teams out there to acquire that experience. The thought of building a robotic submarine also seemed a little more unique to me than other project teams. Also, after I watched the 2014 competition video at the info session, I knew I had to apply!</p>

  <p><b>What is your current project and what is the progress on it?</b></p>

  <p>My current project is the downward manipulator on Thor as well as the custom pneumatic pistons that power it. I enjoy the challenge of this project because there some heavy space constraints on the size of the sub that lead me to implement a "scissor arm" that hasn't really been tried before. I really hope it works out alright.</p>

  <p><b>Any cool summer plans?</b></p>

  <p>I was planning on an internship, but then I realized that staying with AUV would be a blast, so that's what I'm doing instead.</p>
