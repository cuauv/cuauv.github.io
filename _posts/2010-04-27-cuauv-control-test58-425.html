On April 25, CUAUV held its third control test with Tachyon, the first with the new computer and full electrical infrastructure.  All systems worked well, and after some additional tuning the vehicle control is now good enough to begin mission testing next week.  In addition to tuning control, the team ran several successful autonomous pipe runs and took images of the new bin shapes.  Pictures to follow.
