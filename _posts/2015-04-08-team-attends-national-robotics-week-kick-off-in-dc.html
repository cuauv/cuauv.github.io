Over spring break, the team traveled to Washington, D.C.s Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum for the National Robotics Week kick-off event. Joined by CUAir, CUAUV participated in an expo with other robotics organizations and university robotics teams from around the country, and got a chance to present its team history and vehicle to a packed auditorium. CUAUV was excited to interact with other expo participants, where we got to learn from other attendees and share our passion for robotics with visitors. The team thanks the Smithsonian and National Robotics Week for letting us be a part of such a great event!
