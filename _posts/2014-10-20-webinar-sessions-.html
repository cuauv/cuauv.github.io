Hello RoboSub Teams!
  We have been receiving quite a few "How to" questions over the past couple months. To promote an open discussion and sharing of knowledge to further advance RoboSub team's vehicles, CUAUV would like to start weekly webinar sessions beginning this Saturday 10/25/14. Webinars (web seminars) will take place over 'Google Hangouts On Air' for about an hour with all the teams that are interested. Each webinar will be dedicated to unique topics such as Sealing Custom Enclosures, Hydrophones System, and Vision Modules. Here is our planned schedule for the webinars:

  Please note that these times are in Eastern Daylight Time.

  Instructions on how to view the stream will be posted at least a day in advance. Each Webinar will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel. Each webinar will also have a question and answer session, so come prepared!
  If you have any questions or suggestions for more topics, e-mail us at leader@cuauv.org.

  See you all there!
