    <p>Much to the amusement to the local press, our software team of Henry Mason and Nick Elser (above) donned their Lawrence of San Diego headwear (which might be hotel towels) in order to read their laptop screens in the sunshine of TRANSDEC. We were also required to keep the electronics rack protected from blowing dirt. Fortunately, Henry and Nick were able to continue polishing their lines of code that control the Proteus during our pool tests today. The mission software was able to track the optical beacons on the buoys, identify and hover over marker bins, grab the treasure, and surface with it in the recovery zone. Check back soon for more media from today's testing.</p>
