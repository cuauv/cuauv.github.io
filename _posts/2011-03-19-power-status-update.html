The Power sub-team has recently finalized the battery pod board. The board has the same core functions as it did last year; however, there is a new battery management chip specifically designed to handle the necessary tasks. In addition, instead of using small fuel gauge IC components, there will be a fully integrated DCDC and a more efficient cell voltage measurement that uses a sample-and-hold measurement style instead of the old voltage divider. The new battery management also has freed up I/O pins, which will allow for future expansion. Moreover, if all goes well, charging the vehicles battery will not require a charging station but will be as easy as charging a laptop. Stay tuned to our weekly status updates regarding the recent finish of our design process...
