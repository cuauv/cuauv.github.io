  CUAUV had a fantastic time at the Ithaca Sciencenter's Showtime Presentation last Saturday! The presentation started with a discussion about what robots are, what submarines do, and our team. The talk was followed by several demos including a computer vision activity and the definite favorite- a torpedo shooting demo. It was great to see how enthusiastic all the kids were and how much they wanted to learn!
