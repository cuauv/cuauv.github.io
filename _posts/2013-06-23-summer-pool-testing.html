  CUAUV has been spending the past few weeks testing Ragnark almost every night in Teagle Hall, one of the pools on Cornell's campus. We will continue to do so for the next few weeks, up until it's time to leave for the RoboSub competition in San Diego, CA. All mechanical and electrical systems are in place, and the software team is eager to test with all of our new mission elements!
