CUAUV has been testing in the campus pool, Teagle Hall, six nights per week in preparation for RoboSub. We are also working hard on putting together our 2014 Competition Video. The team has experimented with different lighting and visual effects, which has led to a fun, creative, and challenging experience. Keep an eye out for the video this weekend!
