<p>After flights that were remarkably free of delays, cancellations, confusions, and all the other mix-ups that plagued CUAUV's trip out to San Diego last year, the team arrived in San Diego to the news that the rental car payment had never been processed and that the FedEx guy had refused to pick up the boxes containing, among other things, Nova. Thanks to Dorothy in ECE, the confusion was resolved and the crates shipped and should arrive tomorrow. The team spent the afternoon enjoying the beautiful San Diego weather before plunging into the AUVSI competition.</p>
