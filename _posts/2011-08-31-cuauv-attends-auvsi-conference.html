  This year, CUAUV had the privilege to be a part of <a href="http://symposium.auvsi.org/auvsi11/public/enter.aspx" target="_blank">AUVSIs Unmanned Systems North America 2011 Symposium</a>. The event is a premier forum for reviewing, assessing, and discussing the current state of the unmanned systems industry. More than 6,500 attendees from over 40 countries participated in the conference, which took place August 16th to August 19th in Washington, DC.

  The team had its own exhibit at the convention, which afforded us the opportunity to connect with our sponsors such as Seacon, Lockheed and Martin, Solidworks, Microstrain, PNI, Pelican Storm Case, Maxon, and Teledyne. CUAUV also mingled with fellow teams such as SONIA AUV from Quebec, Robotics @ Maryland from the University of Maryland, and URI AUV from the University of Rhode Island.
