The team had an exciting time today participating in two events on campus. One group held a table in Duffield at Tau Beta Pi's Science and Engineering Fair talking to many people about the team and about the vehicle. At the same time, another group of CUAUV team members were in the lab hosting prospective students building balloon-powered boats. The prospective students then raced them against each other to see who's boat was the fastest.
