<p><span>A new video from the downward camera on Triton while it runs a completely autonomous practice mission in the Teagle Pool has been released.<br /><br />The mission being run starts with a zigzag search until the pipe is found. Once found, the vehicle centers itself over the pipe. Once the pipe is centered in frame, the vehicle grabs the heading and follows it. After the second pipe, the vehicle takes off for the safe (which you can't see in the downward camera).</span></p>
    <p>The video can be seen on youtube and is embedded below. For a higher-resolution version (4.5 MB), click <a href="/files/trition-pipe-following-test.avi">here.</a></p>
