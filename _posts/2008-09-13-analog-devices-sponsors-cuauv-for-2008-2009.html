<p>CUAUV is pleased to announce that Analog Devices will continue to sponsor the team for 2008-2009. Analog Devices has generously donated two copies of Analog's VisualDSP++ for Sharcs. These licenses will allow the team to switch over to Sharc processors, which will form basis of a new USBL direction-finding system for the new competition vehicle.</p>
