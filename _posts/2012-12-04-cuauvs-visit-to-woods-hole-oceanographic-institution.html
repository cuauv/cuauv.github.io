  CUAUV recently returned from a visit to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, MA! WHOI, established in 1930, continues to be a leading institution in ocean science and engineering. The day started with a fantastic breakfast followed by several tours of WHOIs engineering laboratories. In addition, the team was able to see various AUVs, ROVs, and HOVs including Alvin, a human occupied submersible that discovered the Titanic! The day ended with the teams presentation to the WHOI engineers and scientists followed by a question and answer session. It was great to hear suggestions and comments from the engineers and CUAUV thanks WHOI for hosting us!
