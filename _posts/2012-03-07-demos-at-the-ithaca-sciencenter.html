  Last Saturday, CUAUV gave a presentation at the Ithaca Sciencenter. The presentation turned out very well; we talked about the team and the vehicle as well as give demos of what the vehicle can do such as shoot torpedos. The demos really got the children excited. We are happy to be part of a great event and hope to participate again in the next semester.
