  <p><b>How did you find out about CUAUV, and what made you want to apply?</b></p>
  <p>I found out about AUV through an event during Cornell Days, actually. There were a number of engineering-related clubs tabling at Duffield, and AUV was the most friendly and helpful group there. Once I got to Cornell, I started to see AUV members and t-shirts every time I went into Duffield, and I knew that I wanted to do electrical engineering, so the team seemed like a perfect fit for me.</p>

  <p><b>What is your favorite part of Cornell so far?</b></p>
  <p>My favorite part about Cornell has to be how nerdy everyone here is. There's a surprising amount of community bonding over problem sets, Smash, and computer hardware and I love seeing the passion that my friends - not just the engineers - have for their projects. </p>

  <p><b>Who is you celebrity crush?</b></p>
  <p>Taylor Swift. Is this even a question?</p>
