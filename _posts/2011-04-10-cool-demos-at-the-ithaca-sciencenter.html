On Saturday, April 9th, 2011, CUAUV hosted an outreach event at the Ithaca Sciencenter. During our presentation, we led cool demos with the kids, like torpedo launching and image recognition. We were excited to bring hands-on science activities to Ithacas youth and look forward to doing more presentations in the near future at the Sciencenter!
