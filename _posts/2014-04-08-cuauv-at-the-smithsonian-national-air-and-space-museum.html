Over spring break, several members of the team, along with CUAir, traveled to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. to kick off National Robotics Week. Markus, Ellen, Mark and Alex tabled at the event on April 4th and 5th, and they were able to talk to a lot of people about AUVs and robotics and give a presentation. The team was even featured on USA Today! In addition, Cornell Engineering put together a short video of the trip after returning to campus.

  While the team was in Washington, D.C., they also took part and presented at a Cornell Engineering Alumni event called "Experiential Learning - The Student Project Team Experience at Cornell."
