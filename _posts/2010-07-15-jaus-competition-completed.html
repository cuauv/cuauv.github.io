Today, the software team completed the Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS) student interoperability challenge. This is the first year JAUS is contributing to the AUVSI competition scoring system. JAUS is the premier interoperability standard for unmanned systems, used in a variety of commercial and industrial applications worldwide. The interoperability Challenge for 2010 required CUAUV to interact with a control and monitoring system using these industry standard protocols.
