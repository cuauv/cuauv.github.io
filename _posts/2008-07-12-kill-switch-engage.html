    <p>Pictured above, team members Brad Factor and Brian Mittereder show off the latest addition to Triton, the vehicle's kill and mission start switches. The kill switch enables and disables Triton's thrusters. Likewise, the mission start switch toggles mission running on and off. Both switches display their status visually with LED's and are magnetically actuated and epoxy cast to avoid corrosion issues. They will be tested at tomorrow's pool test.</p>
