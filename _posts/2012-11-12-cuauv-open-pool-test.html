  Come out to CUAUV's annual Open Pool Test this Sunday, November 18, from 5:30-7:00pm at Teagle Hall (Back Door). It will be a great opportunity to learn more about the team, the competition, and see Killick, CUAUV's 2012 competition vehicle, go through an obstacle course similar to the one at the competition! The live demo will show Killick shooting torpedoes and performing various tasks completely autonomously!

  Snacks will be provided as well.
