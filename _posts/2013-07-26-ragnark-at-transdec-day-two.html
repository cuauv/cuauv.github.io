  <i>One of the programs used and designed by our software team, called CAVE, CUAUV Automated Vision Evaluator, featuring a volunteer Navy diver, Brian Adams. It is used to help software to test and see the effects of changes in their vision code without having to actually have the submarine in the water.

  <p> Our second day started very similarly to the first. We raced to beat the sunrise to TRANSDEC and won. We were also the first team to arrive, which allowed us to sign up for more favorable time slots to do our practice runs.</p>
  <p> We managed to get four runs into our time at TRANSDEC, and we tried multiple full autonomous missions throughout the day. We didnt have any problems connecting to the sub or getting any part of our sub to mechanically or electrically function, which we were happy about.</p>
  <p> During our time in the water, we improved our hydrophones approach, saving us valuable competition time, and our torpedo task was successful under new lighting conditions. While we were able to turn the steering wheel, the code was still being worked on, seeing as Daves course is still proving to be challenging, as expected.</p>
  <p> Wednesday was also the day for team pictures and videos. We brought Ragnark up the hill to his new Mustang convertible, courtesy of the photo shoot. Although we didnt have enough time to finish our pictures and videos the first time we came up, later that day, after our final practice run, we traveled back up to finish the job. No one had really thought of any ideas for our crazy film, so after some hectic scrambling we managed settle on fourteen team members piling into the five seat car while cheering Edward Gong on as he did a backflip in front of the car. We were told it turned out amazing.</p>
  <p> After a long, satisfying day at the pool, we returned to the Kona Kai. Software continued to work diligently on the submarine code; however, since there were no mechanical or electrical issues to fix, we managed to relax a bit with some smores and a little friendly volleyball game against a fellow competing RoboSub team, S.O.N.I.A.. Since we did not keep track of points during the game, we left the title of Number One Volleyball Champion of RoboSub up to the last point won in the game. And now, CUAUV would like to congratulate S.O.N.I.A. on their new title of honor.</p>
