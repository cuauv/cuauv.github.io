This past month, members of CUAUV was invited to meet with a panel 4 students from the Latino Leadership Summit on campus. At the time, these high school students competed in MATE ROV, and with $800 and little experience, took on the competition's heavyweight MIT. Their story was turned into the 2015 film Spare Parts, which has since received national acclaim. CUAUV was able to meet with the panel, discuss the challenges of such a competition, and provide a tour of CUAUV's own lab space and facilities. We are thrilled to have been able to meet these inspiring students!
