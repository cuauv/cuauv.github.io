  On April 27, CUAUV hosted our annual Boy Scouts Workshop in Upson to teach the scouts about robotics and talk about the team. The scouts spent the day building their own mini-submarines from SeaPerch kits. The finished kits are then tested in an inflatable pool. The scouts each earned a Robotics Merit Badge. Special thanks to everyone who came out to help and SeaPerch for the robotics kits!
