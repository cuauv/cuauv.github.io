<p>After an adventurous first day, the team finally arrived in San Diego.  Starting with a 4:15 am meeting time, CUAUV loaded up the cars and drove to the Syracuse Airport.  Flight delays, followed by cancellations, resulted in the team driving back to Ithaca and taking an afternoon flight.  Upon arriving at San Diego at 8:30 pm PST, CUAUV encountered problems with hotel rooms and rental cars.  However, everything was eventually sorted out and the team enjoyed a much needed night of rest.  CUAUV is excited to assemble Triton today and hopes to have everything ready for pool testing tonight.</p>
