    <p>Team members Kirill Kalinichev and Peter Sullivan display Triton's new battery pod boards. The boards function in monitoring and battery safety. Unlike the boards for last year's vehicle, these boards will be positioned on the top of the rack. This ensures that the boards will not be damaged if a leak occurs in the battery pod.</p>
