The sensor team has made some improvements from last years model. This year, the team is using three boards and a custom-built IMU instead of last years 3DM-GX1. The IMU, or Inertial Measurement Unit, integrates two COTS sensors, reports linear acceleration and angular velocity, and is easier to customize.  It is also less than half the price as last years 3DM-GX1. Stay tuned to our weekly status updates regarding the recent finish of our design process...
