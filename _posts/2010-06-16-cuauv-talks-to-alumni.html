    On Friday and Saturday, June 11 and 12, CUAUV participated in the "All-Alumni Affair" held in Barton Hall.  The event is part of Cornell's annual Reunion Weekend, which brings over 6,500 alumni back to campus every year.  Pictured above, Brian Mittereder and JB Rajsky discuss CUAUV and Tachyon with an alumnus.
