<p>As you have probably already read from the post below, CUAUV won first place at the AUVSI/ONR RoboSub competition!  Congratulations to everyone involved and everyone who helped this become a reality!</p>

  <p>The day began by "sleeping in" for the first time in a while and arriving at TRANSDEC at 8am to prepare for our 10:20am practice run.  The first 19 minutes of our 40 minute practice run were spent doing a full mission run.  Were were successfully able to complete all elements of the course, including the transport hydrophone task.  The only things that stopped it from being a 100% completetion of the course were that we skipped the second wire to save time and dropped the recover object to the right of the stand rather than directly on top of it.  We were extremely happy with this run!  The last 21 minutes were spent doing tuning on several mission elements, mainly on the emperor task, because even though we got both of them it took a rather long amount of time.</p>

  <p>At 4:00pm, our final run started.  In between the two runs, we spent time just relaxing and doing whatever minor work needed to be done on the sub.  The run began by successfully completing the validation gate, buoys, and wire.  During the bins, we only dropped on one bin, although it appeared that we had lined up and were ready to drop on the second.  We then moved on to the torpedo target where we were successfully shot two torpedoes through the small holes.  The emperor was next, where we successfully knocked off one grape before moving to the hydrophone task.  We completed all parts of the hydrophone task, including identifying the correct pinger, picking up the recovery object, moving to the other pinger, surfacing in the correct octagon, and dropping the recovery object.  At that point, the run ended at slightly after 14 minutes.  We couldn't have been happier to have this run for our final run!</p>

  <p>Later that night at the awards ceremony, we were presented with first place and a check for $8000, an 3rd generation Intel processor and motherboard, a nail (for Cor-nailed-it, one of Dave's jokes), and a set of mini lego men.  On top of that, we also won an award for first place in static judging that came with another check for $500.  Again, congratulations to everyone on CUAUV and everyone who helped make this a reality! </p>
