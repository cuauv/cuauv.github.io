Thanks to Kevin Markwardt and the Ithaca Swim Club for letting us take pictures of the mission elements in their pool!  From 8-9am this morning, we got to test our vision algorithms in bright sunlight in preparation for TRANSDEC.  All of them work well with only a little extra tuning.

    Also, the active grabber went on Tachyon for last night's pool test.  After removing a few teeth that were causing it to grab too well, it picked up and dropped successfully several times in a mission.  We will continue to work with it to improve reliability in both grabbing and releasing today and tomorrow. Two pool tests left before Tachyon ships!<p><center><a href="/files/2010summer/ElementsInPool.jpg"><img src="/files/2010summer/ElementsInPool.preview.jpg" alt="Our mission elements in the outdoor pool" /></a><a href="/files/2010summer/JBSun.jpg"><img src="/files/2010summer/JBSun.preview.jpg" alt="JB taking shelter from the sun" /></a>
