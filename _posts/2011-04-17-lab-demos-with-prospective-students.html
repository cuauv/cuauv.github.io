On Friday, April 15th, CUAUV led lab demonstrations with Cornell prospective students. The purpose of the Cornell Admissions Lab Demonstration is to get students excited about Cornell Engineering and encourage them to join engineering project teams in the fall. Hopefully, we see some of the students we met during the fall recruitment next year! Go Big Red!
