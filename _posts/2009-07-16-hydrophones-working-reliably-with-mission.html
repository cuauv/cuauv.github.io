For the first time in several years, the hydrophones are working reliably before the competition!  During the July 15 pool test, Nova was able to complete eight out of eight hydrophones missions completely autonomously.

    Nova also fully autonomously ran the following run:
    Barbed wire -> machine gun nest -> bins, drop on correct targets -> follow hydrophones to recovery zone -> pick up briefcase, -> surface in the recovery zone with briefcase.
    The team is very excited about these results, and will be spending the next week running autonomous missions in Teagle pool to pinpoint and fix any software bugs.

    Pictures and videos coming soon.
