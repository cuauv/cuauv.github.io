Yesterday CUAUV conducted its final pool test with Tachyon prior to shipping to San Diego.  The pool test was highly successful: Tachyon completed the course untethered autonomous several times, including launching torpedoes, dropping markers in the correct bins, picking up and dropping the recovery object.  Video of one of these runs:
