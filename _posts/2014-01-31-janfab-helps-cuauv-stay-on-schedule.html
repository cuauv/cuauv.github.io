CUAUV team members returned to campus just a week after the New Year to participate in JanFab, a two-week period over winter break where students work around the clock to prepare for upcoming competitions. The team spend hours in the Emerson Manufacturing Lab in Rhodes Hall every day to get as much machining done as possible. This helps the team stay ahead of schedule before the workload from the semester piles up.
