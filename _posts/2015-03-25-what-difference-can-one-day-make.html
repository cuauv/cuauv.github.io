What difference can one day make? Cornell Giving Day is a 24-hour coming-together to support Cornell. You can make a gift to CUAUV by visiting <a href="https://givingday.cornell.edu/">https://givingday.cornell.edu/</a>, selecting College of Engineering under "College or area", selecting Other under "Fund", and entering "CUAUV" under Comments/Other Designation. Your gift can help unlock up to $300,000 in challenge money to Cornell colleges, schools, and units!

  Let's make a difference!
