On February 14th, a group of CUAUV members traveled to the Ithaca Sciencenter to teach guests about AUV technology and demonstrate our vehicle. By the end, young visitors were able to tell what components make up a robot and got to interact with the team's vehicle in a color recognition demo. The team had a blast at the Sciencenter, and we can't wait to come back soon!
