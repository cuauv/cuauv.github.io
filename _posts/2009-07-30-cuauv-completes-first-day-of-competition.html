The team completed three practice runs today at TRANSDEC.  Nova was able to pass through the validation gate, follow pipelines, hit the buoy, drop markers, fire torpedoes, follow the hydrophones, grab the safe, and surface in the recovery zone.

    Problems were encountered when it was discovered that the practice side pinger was louder than the ones on the competition side.  The briefcase grabbing code also had to be modified.  However, CUAUV is extremely excited about how well things are going the first day and is excited for the days to come.
