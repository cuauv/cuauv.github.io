<p>On Friday, May 29, CUAUV visited the Woods Hole Oceanograhic Institution (WHOI). The team went on a tour of the facilities, listened to various presentations from WHOI employees, and gave a talk on Nova. CUAUV found the experience to be extremely rewarding, having learned many things that can be used to improve Nova and other future vehicles.  Pictures from the trip can be found in the <a href="http://www.cuauv.org/image/tid/62">WHOI Trip 2009</a> image gallery.</p>
