The first batch of parts are back from annodization, so we are able to start putting all the pieces together for Killick, our 2011-2012 competition vehicle. This is a very exciting process for the team to see our year-long effort taking shape. We are currently waiting for the second batch of parts to come back so we can all continue building Killick.

  The image below is our current progress!
