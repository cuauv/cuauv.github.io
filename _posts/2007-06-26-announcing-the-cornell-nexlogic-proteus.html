    CUAUV is proud to announce Nexlogic as the team's 2007 Diamond sponsor! Nexlogic is a premier provider of PCB design, fabrication, and assembly services. This year they provided our team with much of the custom designed circuit boards that power the Proteus autonomous underwater vehicle. Ever since Don Shell, Nexlogic's Director of Business Development, approached us with his company's intent to help student engineering projects, we've been impressed by Nexlogic's level of support. They truly understand the type of problems that a small engineering team faces and have committed themselves to solving them. CUAUV is therefore proud to officially announce our 2007 AUV, the Cornell-Nexlogic Proteus!
