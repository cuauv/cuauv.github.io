In early April, Boy Scouts troops from the Ithaca and surrounding area visited Cornell. With the generosity of kits provided by SeaPerch and mentorship from CUAUV and CUAir members, scouts constructed remotely operated submersibles made from PVC, film canister thrusters, and custom remote controllers. After lunch provided by Dominos, students were able to test (and in some cases, crash test) their ROVs in a small pool on Upsons outdoor patio. Scouts were awarded their robotics merit badge to symbolize the days accomplishment. CUAUV had a blast working with the Boy Scouts again this year!
