  <p>As the spring semester is coming to an end, CUAUV has been very busy with public outreach events in Ithaca. We have had a variety of events including Caroline Steam Night, Trumansburg Middle School STEM Career Day, Girl Scouts Product Design Workshop with SWE, Bring Your Child to Work Day, and the RAW Expo: Glitch. All the events were a success and extremely fun for team members and participants alike. We will have more fun and exciting events in the future so stay tuned to our news page as the RoboSub competition nears!</p>
